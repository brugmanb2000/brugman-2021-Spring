## Notes/Extras

Make sure you're changing the default purple color of the UI to something custom.

Add margins to the side of your buttons

Otherwise, the UI is looking pretty good.

I like that you demoed the app with multiple emulators.

Missing P3 requirements

Readme looks good with the animated gif.
