- Image Viewer - Image Viewer: Once pumped up to 100, it changes the image on the image viewer

### Android Emulator's Used: 

My Android Emulator used a Galaxy Nexus 30 and Nexus One. 

Primarily used Galaxy Nexus 30 and is formatted to fit that one best. Still learning the formatting part, but Nexus One still works but is a little uglier.
