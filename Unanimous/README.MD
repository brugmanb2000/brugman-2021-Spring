# Unanimous - Project 1
## By Brandon Brugman

### Summary
The point of this app is test using the camera APIs, having fragments speak to each other without using the main activity, and for using REST APIs to pull data into the app. My app succeeds on all fronts and does all of the above. 

Currently, it is set up as a starting point for my app called Unanimous which is going to be based around friends logging in, picking movies they want to watch, and then voting to see which ones. Because of such, some of these features may fall to the wayside until later, but it is exciting to have them! 

### Features

1) Camera
This one is fairly self explanatory. This one involes going to the Camera activity and selecting the button to take a picture. It currently does bug out if you try to exit the activity. I would focus on fixing this bug, but my app won't feature a camera moving forward so fixing bugs on this activity isn't a huge priority.

2) Preferences
The game plan for this activity is to have users enter in movies they like as "preferences" and will eventually be uploaded into a database and pulled back down from there. Currently, it is used to for transfering text from one fragment to another. This will be useful moving forward as one fragment can record a user's movie preferences while the other fragment can hold onto that data. Currently, it can copy text onto a ViewModel and then paste that information on the other fragment. It can also reset as well. 

3) Selections
The point of this section will be where users can make a selection on the movie they want to watch. This is where the REST API comes into play. Here, a user can enter in a text field and search for the title and overview from the The Movie Database's selections. This will let the user know if it sounds interesting or not. From there, I plan on having this be similar to Tindr, where a user can like/dislike a movie that comes through until all users agree on a movie together. Currently, there is a bug for searching for a movie that cannot be found. That bug is my highest priority currently.
